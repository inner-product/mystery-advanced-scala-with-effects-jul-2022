# Day 1

## Introductions

- Name
- Programming experience
- Scala experience
- Things you want to learn / issues you want to solve


## Overview

### General

- Our curriculum is not fixed. We have a rough plan but it will change depending on your interests.
- We have 5 3.5 hr sessions. We'll have a 30 min break about half way through
- Exercises at https://github.com/inner-product/essential-exercises
- This repo at https://github.com/inner-product/mystery-advanced-scala-with-effects-jul-2022


### Rules

1. Cameras / mics on please, unless you have a good reason

2. Pets (and small children) are welcome to join us, but you should introduce them to everyone else. Older children, friends, housemates, partners, etc. are also welcome but don't need to be introduced.

3. You are ultimately responsible for your learning. Three hints:
  1. Ask questions at any time. "I don't understand this and I don't know how to form a clearer question" is a great question!
  2. Collaborate with other students. Explain what you are doing to them. Explain what you're thinking. "I don't know what to do right now" is a great thing to say.
  3. Take notes.


### Curriculum

- Reasoning about effects
- IO basics
- Interpreters
- Type classes


### Goals
